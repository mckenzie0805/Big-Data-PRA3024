# Analysis of Big Data in Physics

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks developed for the course **PRA3024 – Analysis of Big Data in Physics**, part of the Maastricht Science Programme.  
The course focuses on applying data analysis, statistics, and computational techniques to real-world physics datasets.

## Course Overview

Modern physics relies heavily on large and complex datasets generated by experiments and observations.  
This course introduces the systematic analysis of such data, combining programming, statistics, and physical reasoning to extract meaningful results and assess their significance.

Key themes include:
- Data handling and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and uncertainty estimation
- Error analysis, correlations, and significance testing
- Awareness of false positives in data
- Working with diverse physics datasets

## Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Notes

These notebooks were created as part of academic coursework and demonstrate data analysis workflows rather than production-ready software.
